####Motivations
Very rarely we have an option to start new project from green field.
Much often we need to add featutes to already existing product. 
We don't want to or simply can not do deep refactoring. 
What we can do is integrating already existing application elements.

Let's achive this with *Immutable.js* and *Reactive.io*
